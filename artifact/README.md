# Making Formulog Fast

Welcome to the artifact for "Making Formulog Fast" (artifact #45, paper #434).

This README is organized as follows:

- Introduction
- Hardware Dependencies
- Getting Started Guide (Phase 1)
- Step-by-Step Instructions (Phase 2)
- Reusability Guide

## Introduction

Formulog extends the logic programming language Datalog with first-order functional programming and SMT solving; its goal is to make it possible to write SMT-based program analyses (e.g., symbolic execution and refinement type checking) in a way that is declarative (at the level of mathematical specification) while still being amenable to high-level optimizations and efficient evaluation.

Our paper explores two approaches to making Formulog faster:

- We implement a compiler that transpiles the functional and SMT fragment of Formulog to C++ and the Datalog fragment to Soufflé, a leading Datalog solver that compiles Datalog to C++.
- We develop eager evaluation, a novel Datalog evaluation algorithm that can lead to advantageous distributions of Formulog's SMT workload on SMT-heavy benchmarks.

### Supported Claims

This artifact supports the following main claims:

1. On the Formulog benchmark suite, compiling Formulog leads to speedups over interpreting Formulog (~2x arithmetic mean speedup in our experiments) as well as much less memory usage (~38x arithmetic mean less in our experiments).
2. On SMT-heavy benchmarks, interpreting Formulog using eager evaluation leads to speedups over compiling Formulog to off-the-shelf Soufflé (~5x arithmetic mean speedup in our experiments).
3. On SMT-heavy benchmarks, compiling Formulog to our modified version of Soufflé that uses eager evaluation leads to speedups over interpreting Formulog with eager evaluation (~2x arithmetic mean speedup in our experiments).
4. On SMT-heavy benchmarks, using eager evaluation typically (although not universally) leads to faster SMT solving times compared to using semi-naive evaluation.
5. Our improvements to Formulog---compilation and (on SMT-heavy benchmarks) eager evaluation---help Formulog be competitive with previously published, non-Datalog implementations of a range of SMT-based program analyses.
6. Eager evaluation can be added to existing Datalog infrastructure with relatively low amounts of new code (~500 SLOC in the Formulog interpreter, and ~500 SLOC in Soufflé).

Claims 1-5 can be evaluated by either analyzing the data we collected in our experiments (in the directory `paper-results/regular/` in the artifact) or by using the scripts we provide to rerun our experiments.
In either case, the data analysis scripts we provide can calculate the statistics we report throughout the paper (including those in Table 1), and also generate Figure 2 (relevant to claim 1), Figure 6 (relevant to claims 2-4), and Table 2 (relevant to claims 1-5). 

Claim 6 can be evaluated by running the utility `cloc` on the source directories contained in this artifact (we provide a script for this).

More details are given in the instructions below.

### Unsupported Claims

Our experimental setup does not run the original (non-Formulog) version of the Dminor type checker; as noted in Section 6.1 of our paper, the original Dminor implementation can run only on an old, resource-constrained version of .NET, and so we just report the performance numbers given for it in the original Formulog paper.

The paper reviewers have requested that we include some limited scalability experiments in the final version of the paper; these experiments have not been designed yet and so are not part of this artifact.

## Hardware Dependencies

For the "kick-the-tires" phase of the artifact evaluation, a moderately powerful laptop (x86 or ARM) that can run Docker should be sufficient---say, a laptop with at least 4 vCPUs and 8 GB RAM.
We have tested the "kick-the-tires" phase on these machines:
- a 2023 M2 MacBook Pro with 10 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM
- an x86 Ubuntu server with 4 vCPUs and 8 GB RAM

For the full evaluation of the artifact, a more powerful machine is necessary (~40 vCPUs, ~200 GB of memory).
We will give artifact reviewers anonymous SSH access to an AWS EC2 with the correct specs.
Access will be coordinated via the AEC chairs.
Reviewers will need to ensure that only one reviewer is running experiments on the EC2 at a time. 

## Getting Started Guide (Phase 1)

You should be able to run these experiments on a moderately powerful laptop that has Docker.
In the `vms/` directory, there are two archived Docker images, one for x86 and one for ARM (e.g., M1+ Macs).
Both images contain the software (and scripts) necessary for running the Formulog experiments in the paper; however, only the x86 one also supports running the reference implementations from Section 6.1 (e.g., KLEE and the original Scuba points-to analysis), as we were unable to get them to work on ARM.
We recommend using whichever image matches your architecture (it might be possible to run the other image via emulation, but this will be quite slow).

Make sure Docker is configured to give containers at least 4 CPUs (more is better) and 8 GB RAM (more is better); to see what the current setting is, grep for "CPUs" and "Total Memory" in the output of the command `docker info`.
If you are using Docker Desktop on Mac, you can increase the resource limits following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#advanced).

To load the x86 image and start an interactive Docker container based on it named `mff` (for "Making Formulog Fast"), run these commands:

```bash
docker load < vms/mff-amd64.tar.gz
docker run --name mff -it mff-amd64
```

To do the same for the ARM image, run these commands:

```bash
docker load < vms/mff-arm64.tar.gz
docker run --name mff -it mff-arm64
```

### Experiment #1: Test Experimental Infrastructure

Once you are in the Docker container, you can run a script that will run a set of relatively small experiments:

```
./scripts/kicktires.sh phase1-results
```

On a 2023 M2 MacBook Pro with 10 vCPUS and 16 GB RAM this takes 8 minutes; on an Ubuntu server with 4 vCPUs and 8 GB RAM this takes XXX.

The previous command will populate the directory `~/phase1-results` with output files from the experiment.
Each file is named according to this convention:

```
[case-study]__[benchmark]__[SMT-mode]__[eval-mode]__[trial-num].txt
```

We use two SMT modes in our experiments, `csa` (short for `check-sat-assuming`) and `pp` (short for `push-pop`).
These determine the encoding the Formulog runtime uses for incremental SMT solving (see [an ICLP'20 extended abstract](https://aaronbembenek.github.io/papers/datalog-incr-smt-iclp2020.pdf) for more details).

The possible values for `[eval-mode]` are:

- `interpret`: use Formulog interpreter in semi-naive mode
- `interpret-reorder`: reorder each rule body so delta atom is first (the order implicitly used by eager evaluation), and then use Formulog interpreter in semi-naive mode
- `interpret-unbatched`: use Formulog interpreter in eager evaluation mode
- `compile`: use Formulog compiler to generate code performing semi-naive evaluation
- `compile-reorder`: reorder each rule body so delta atom is first (the order implicitly used by eager evaluation), and then use Formulog compiler to generate code performing semi-naive evaluation
- `compile-unbatched`: use Formulog compiler to generate code performing eager evaluation
- `klee`, `cbmc`, `scuba`: the non-Datalog reference implementations described in Section 6.1 of the paper

The raw output logs can be turned into a CSV using the script `scripts/process_logs.py`, and the CSV values can be summarized using the script `scripts/summarize_kicktires.py`:

```bash
./scripts/process_logs.py phase1-results/* | ./scripts/summarize_kicktires.py
```

This is the summary we received on the M2 Mac laptop (note that the reference implementations `scuba` and `klee` did not run, since here we used the ARM Docker image):

```
dminor/all-10
	compile-reorder 5.10s
	compile-unbatched 1.58s
	interpret-reorder 10.53s
	interpret-unbatched 5.15s
scuba/polyglot
	scuba NA
	compile 112.47s
symex/shuffle-4
	klee NA
	compile-reorder 1.56s
	compile-unbatched 0.29s
	interpret-reorder 1.86s
	interpret-unbatched 1.34s
```

While this experiment uses a small set of relatively fast-running benchmarks, our results are generally in line with the paper's claims: compilation leads to speedups over interpretation; interpreting with eager evaluation can be faster than compiled semi-naive on SMT-heavy case studies (dminor and symex); and compiled eager evaluation is faster than interpreted eager evaluation.

This is the output we received on the resource-constrained Ubuntu server (using the x86 Docker image):

```
XXX
```

Formulog does not perform as strongly here due to the low number of cores on the server (only 4 vCPUs); however, you can see that it still beats klee by a wide margin in the symex experiment.

### Experiment #2: Count SLOC for Eager Evaluation Implementations

In the paper, we claim that eager evaluation can be relatively easily added to existing Datalog infrastructure.
To demonstrate this, we have provided a script to count the number of lines of code needed to support eager evaluation in the Formulog interpreter and Soufflé code generator:

```
./scripts/count_sloc.sh
```

This should print out some statistics about lines of code using the `cloc` utility; in particular, that our eager evaluation implementation in the Formulog interpreter consists of 481 SLOC Java, and our extensions to Souffle required modifying 59 SLOC, adding 558 SLOC, and removing 2 SLOC (all in C++).

## Step-by-Step Instructions (Phase 2)

You will need to SSH onto a provisioned AWS EC2 to run these experiments (or run the x86 Docker container on a machine with ~200 GB RAM and ~40 vCPUs).
We will coordinate with the AEC chairs about getting you the server's address and password.
You can SSH onto the server like so:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@[server-address]
```

You will then be required to enter the password.
We will disable SSH logging, so access is anonymous.
Reviewers will need to ensure that they are using the server one-at-a-time, in order that their experiments do not clash.

The server will have the same structure and content as the x86 Docker image.
The script for running the full set of experiments is `scripts/full_eval.sh`.
Please edit it (with `vim` or `nano`) to configure the experiment to your liking.
We recommend adjusting three dimensions:

- the number of trials per configuration (default: 10)
- the timeout per trial (default: 30 minutes)
- the benchmarks to run (default: all)

See the script for more information on how to change these settings.
We do not recommend changing which modes are run (e.g., `compile`, `compile-unbatched`, ...), as our data analysis script can break if not all modes are present; furthermore, our data analysis script assumes at least one benchmark is run per case study.

**Our recommendation is to run one trial of every benchmark, with a timeout of 30 minutes.**
(This is the default setting, except for the number of trials.)
This should take 12-14 hours to complete; if you have more time at your disposal, you can increase the number of trials.
By our calculations, if you were to run a single trial of every configuration with a timeout of 10 minutes, it would take 7-9 hours to complete.

Once you have configured the experiment to your liking, run it with this command:

```bash
./scripts/full_eval.sh phase2-results/raw
```

This will populate the directory `phase2-results/raw/` with the raw output logs from the experiment (named according to the same convention as the Phase 1 results).
To process and analyze the logs, run these commands (where `[timeout]` is the timeout used in the experiments, measured in seconds):

```bash
cd phase2-results
../scripts/process_logs.py raw/* > results.csv
python3 ../scripts/analysis.py results.csv [timeout] > stats.txt
```

(You can safely ignore the numpy warnings.)
This command will create a file `stats.txt` with the statistics (about speedups, memory usage, etc.) we cite in the paper (we explicitly note where we have drawn statistics for Table 1).
It will also populate a `figures/` directory with the figures we use in the paper.
To view these figures, you will need to retrieve the directory from the server and open it on your local machine.
First, in the `phase2-results/` directory on the server, archive the directory:

```bash
zip figures.zip -r figures/
```

Then, from your local machine, retrieve the archived directory:

```bash
scp ubuntu@[server-address]:/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/figures.zip .
```

Once you unzip it, you can view the PDFs for Figures 4 and 6 in the paper.
You can also use LaTeX to build Table 2.
These figures and table should look similar to what is presented in the paper, and the statistics in `stats.txt` should also roughly match the results in the paper.

The experimental results we report in the paper (including raw output logs) are in the directory `paper-results/regular/`; we have already run the data analysis script to generate figures and statistics for them (which you can compare against).

One note about our data analysis script: it assumes that the reference Scuba implementation fails with an error on the `luindex` benchmark (which is what happened in our experiments).
To see whether this holds in your experiments, run this command (on the server):

```bash
grep non-zero ~/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex*scuba*
```

This should return output like this, for the trials that ended in an error (i.e., with a non-zero exit status):

```
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__00.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__01.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__02.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__03.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__04.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__05.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__06.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__07.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__08.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
/home/ubuntu/phase2-results/raw/scuba__luindex__NA__scuba__09.txt:Command exited with non-zero status 1
```

Although there is no particular need to, you can also use the provided Jupyter notebook `scripts/analysis.ipynb` to analyze results (it does the same thing as `scripts/analysis.py`, but in an interactive way).
This will have to be done on your local machine; you will need to move the `results.csv` file off the server (using `scp`), and then also use a Python environment with the following dependencies:

- `notebook`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`

Our reusability guide has more information about digging deeper into our artifact and building on top of it.

## Reusability Guide

The primary reusable components of our artifact are our contributions to the Formulog platform:

1. a compiler from Formulog to off-the-shelf Soufflé;
2. an eager evaluation mode for the Formulog interpreter; and
3. an eager evaluation extension for the Formulog compiler (via an extension to Soufflé).

**All three extensions are feature complete---that is, they work with the full Formulog language (with one small idiosyncrasy), and should work with arbitrary Formulog programs (modulo any bugs, of course!).**
The small idiosyncrasy is that the handwritten parser in the C++ Formulog runtime is not currently able to parse the normal syntactic sugar for SMT formulas, and instead relies on codegen-specific notation; this only affects the parsing of SMT formulas that occur in external fact files (i.e., the `.tsv` files containing the EDB that are loaded at runtime).
This is a minor nuisance---it means that sometimes you need two sets of fact files, one for interpreted Formulog and one for compiled Formulog---but not a fundamental limitation; we plan to update the parser soon.

All three extensions have passed the >200 Formulog evaluation test cases in the `formulog/src/test/resources/` directory.
To run these unit tests, enter the `formulog/` directory and run this command (takes a little over an hour on an M2 MacBook Pro laptop):

```bash
mvn -DtestCodeGen -DtestCodeGenEager package
```

In the subsection "Trying Out Our Formulog Extensions" below we discuss how you can try out our different Formulog extensions for yourself.

In what follows, we discuss each of our extensions in turn, as well as the reusability of our experimental infrastructure.

### Compiler from Formulog to Off-the-Shelf Soufflé

We have built a compiler for Formulog that transpiles the functional and SMT fragment of Formulog to C++ and the Datalog fragment to Soufflé.
Off-the-shelf Soufflé is then used to compile the Soufflé code to C++, which can be linked with the C++ generated by the Formulog compiler.
The compiler consists of ~4.4k lines of Java, plus ~3k lines of C++ for the skeleton Formulog runtime.

Relevant source directories:

- `formulog/src/main/java/edu/harvard/seas/pl/formulog/codegen/`
- `formulog/src/main/java/edu/harvard/seas/pl/formulog/codegen/ast/cpp/`
- `formulog/src/main/java/edu/harvard/seas/pl/formulog/codegen/ast/souffle/`
- `formulog/src/main/resources/codegen/`

The entry point for the compiler is the `codegen.CodeGen` class.
Some classes in the `codegen` package translate specific Formulog language constructs; these classes have names like `[Construct]CodeGen`.
For example, the class `TermCodeGen` defines how to translate a Formulog term (like a constructor or primitive).
Other classes specialize the skeleton Formulog C++ runtime to the program being translated; these classes are named after the C++ file that they fill in (e.g., `SymbolHpp` and `SymbolCpp` for `Symbol.hpp` and `SymbolCpp`, respectively).
The skeleton Formulog C++ runtime can be found in the `formulog/src/main/resources/codegen/` directory.

We expect that the amount of work needed to extend the compiler to support a new Formulog feature will typically be commensurate with the amount of work needed to extend the Formulog interpreter to handle that feature (an exception might be if Soufflé already supports some feature that Formulog does not, in which case extending the Formulog compiler might be easier than extending the interpreter).
Thus, it should be lightweight to extend the compiler with a non-invasive feature (say, new primitive terms representing character literals, or new standard library functions).

### Eager Evaluation for the Formulog Interpreter

We have extended the Formulog interpreter to support eager evaluation.

Relevant source files:

- `formulog/src/main/java/edu/harvard/seas/pl/formulog/eval/AbstractStratumEvaluator` 
- `formulog/src/main/java/edu/harvard/seas/pl/formulog/eval/EagerStratumEvaluator` 
- `formulog/src/main/java/edu/harvard/seas/pl/formulog/eval/RoundBasedStratumEvaluator` 

We have abstracted stratum-level evaluation in the Formulog interpreter with an `AbstractStratumEvaluator` class that includes core functionality shared between evaluation methods.
This abstract class is extended by classes for traditional semi-naive evaluation (`RoundBasedStratumEvaluator`) and eager evaluation (`EagerStratumEvaluator`).
This design makes it easy to extend the Formulog interpreter with alternative evaluation methods.
First, it would be simple to use different evaluation methods for different strata, by dynamically choosing which stratum evaluator class to use on a per-stratum basis.
Second, it is relatively lightweight to add an alternative stratum-level evaluation method by extending the `AbstractStratumEvaluator` class.
For example, using the `EagerStratumEvaluator` class as a guide, it should not be hard to implement a proof-of-concept evaluation method that explores the logical inference space with an order different from DFS (eager evaluation) and BFS (semi-naive evaluation); for example, by choosing which inferences to explore based on some notion of priority.
This should require a few hundred lines of code, while reusing much of the Formulog codebase (>20k SLOC Java, excluding the compiler).

### Eager Evaluation for the Formulog and Soufflé Compilers

We have extended the Soufflé code generator with preliminary support for eager evaluation.
This extension to Soufflé works in a seamless way with our Formulog compiler, and so Formulog programs can be compiled into code performing eager evaluation.
However, it can also be used to generate eager evaluation code for Soufflé programs more generally (i.e., ones not resulting from Formulog compilation).
This means that it can be reused by (the many) tools written in Soufflé, as well as tools that generate Soufflé code.

See `souffle/README.md` ([rendered online](https://github.com/aaronbembenek/souffle/blob/eager-eval/README.md)) for additional information, such as usage and limitations.
The main current limitation is our extension does not support Soufflé's aggregation constructs; however, this is not a fundamental limitation and support could be added in the future.

### Trying Out Our Formulog Extensions

You can try running our extensions to Formulog on an arbitrary Formulog program; say, one you write yourself, or one of the example programs in `formulog/examples`.
To learn more about the Formulog language, check out the language reference in the `formulog/docs/` directory ([rendered online](https://github.com/aaronbembenek/formulog-fork/tree/mff-artifact/docs)), as well as `formulog/README.md` ([rendered online](https://github.com/aaronbembenek/formulog-fork/blob/mff-artifact/README.md)).

Let's assume you want to evaluate the program `formulog/examples/greeting.flg`.
To run it with the Formulog interpreter using semi-naive evaluation, run this command:

```bash
java -jar lib/formulog.jar formulog/examples/greeting.flg --dump-idb
```

To run it with eager evaluation, add the `--eager-eval` flag:

```bash
java -jar lib/formulog.jar formulog/examples/greeting.flg --dump-idb --eager-eval
```

To compile it, run it with the `--codegen` flag:

```bash
java -jar lib/formulog.jar formulog/examples/greeting.flg --codegen
```

This will create a directory `codegen/`.
The directory `codegen/src/` contains the files output by our compiler; the C++ ones are the Formulog runtime (specialized to the program being compiled) and the file `codegen/src/formulog.dl` is the Soufflé version of the Datalog rules from the Formulog program.
To build and run the semi-naive evaluation of this program, run these commands:

```bash
cd ~/codegen
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
./build/flg --dump-idb
```

To instead build and run the eager evaluation of this program, add the appropriate flag when configuring the build: 

```bash
cd ~/codegen
cmake -S . -B build -DFLG_EAGER_EVAL=On
cmake --build build -j
./build/flg --dump-idb
```

If you are curious, the C++ file (generated by Soufflé) implementing semi-naive or eager evaluation for the program is `codegen/build/formulog.cpp`; you might want to format it first before checking it out:

```bash
clang-format -i ~/codegen/build/formulog.cpp
```

### Extending Our Experimental Infrastructure

Finally, we believe that the experimental infrastructure in this artifact can be adapted and reused for future experiments (it itself builds on the artifact published with the OOPSLA'20 Formulog paper).

New Formulog case studies can be added by following the same structure as the existing case studies.
To add a new Formulog case study---say, `foo`---create a directory `benchmarks/foo/` and place in it a file `bench.flg` with the case study code.
Then in the `benchmarks/foo/bms/` directory create a separate subdirectory for each benchmark; each benchmark subdirectory should have an archive `facts.zip` that unzips to a folder `facts` containing the `.tsv` files for each input relation (i.e., the EDB).

Different experiments can be run by modifying the `scripts/full_eval.sh` script, as described above.
That script internally calls the script `scripts/bench.py`; run `scripts/bench.py --help` to see what options are available.
For example, to run a new benchmark, you would select the benchmark's directory (containing the `facts.zip` archive) using the `--benchmark-dirs` option. 

You might note that `scripts/bench.py` also supports running Soufflé case studies (e.g., with the modes `souffle` and `souffle-unbatched` for semi-naive and eager evaluation, respectively).
To add a Soufflé case study---say, `bar`---create a directory `benchmarks/bar/` and place in it a file `bench.dl` with the case study code.
Then in the `benchmarks/bar/bms/` directory create a separate subdirectory for each benchmark; each benchmark subdirectory should have an archive `facts.zip` that unzips to a folder `facts` containing the files for each input relation (i.e., the EDB; these could be `.facts` files).

Unlike the benchmark infrastructure and scripts for running experiments---which we believe are easily reusable---the analysis scripts `scripts/analysis.py` and `scripts/analysis.ipynb` are designed specifically for our experiments.
